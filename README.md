* See project/AT32_IDE/user/arduino_code.cpp file for arduino sketch that controls motor.
* See project/src/main.cpp for main c file with init code.
* You can change pin layout via at32 workbench

Warning: this example project uses arduino core api for compatability with simplefoc library, but this is not a port, many core features are unavalible or mocked.
